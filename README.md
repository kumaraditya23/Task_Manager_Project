#Task Manager


##Description
This is a web application called Task Manager which can be used to track complete/incomplete tasks for a user. It is a modified version of the one suggested in class. It allows a user to create, read, update and delete tasks. Generally, while adding new tasks a user would like to add incomplete tasks more often (to remember them) than complete ones. So, the added tasks are by default added as incomplete tasks and the user can move them to complete while editing. The date at which a task was moved to the complete task table is used as the date at which it was completed.Completed tasks are shown in blue (instead of grey as suggested). This is just a personal preference. Other features are the same as suggested in class.
